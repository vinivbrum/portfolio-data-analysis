Hi, I'm Vinicius. I'm 28 years old, I live in Brazil, and I'm a Data Analyst now.
With 3 years of experience in digital marketing, I worked buying midia, using data driven strategy and analysing the data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads.

I have experience with companies in the healthcare area, and customer acquisition in a b2c business

From the past, I use to be a Dentist in Brazil.

In 2019, I stated buying midia in Facebook Ads for a few dental officers in my city as a Freelancer.
From the last 6 moths I started to use data analysis in digital marketing, using insights to do a data driven strategy to buy midia.

Since then, I have continued to improve my knowledge in the analysis area and consulting.
Now, I'm improving my hard skills in Power Bi, Google Data Studio, SQL and Python.
For my softs skills I'm working in analytic thinking, problem-solving and storytelling

At the moment I'm looking for positions where I can develop my analytical skills and work in a squaq.
With my knowledge in analytics I can develop models and dashboards for customer acquisition, sales, digital marketing and related areas.
At now, I'm focussing in ecommerce and financial fraud areas in my analysis.
